Things to Calculate in Arduino Nano Code (For One Channel).
-- Hardware Bound measurements - Need the whole circuit simulation around Arduino UNO
1. Measure Channel Current through Shunt
2. Measure Main Voltage through Shunt
3. Calculate Power through Channel
4. Monitor Current Overload through Channel
9. Do channel switching (ON/OFF) when requested from the user through the app
10. Recognize Live/Generator input from the user via Web/Bluetooth

-- Can be simulated , not extensive channel hardware required
-- Checklist of the functions (Check them off one by one)
11. Do Phase changes when requested from the user through the app
12. Send and Receive commands to/from the IOT Cloud Database
13. Send and Receive Data to/from the IOT Cloud Database
14. Maintain Date/Time tagging of the channels
15. Capable of reconnecting to Web incase of disconnected
16. When bootup, immediately start tracking the time from the Web OR
	Use a simple RTC Clock module with the Nano 33 IOT.
17. Monitor Battery Status if required and send it also to the Webserver
18. Monitor Temperature of the Board and send it to the Webserver
19. Status of the Channels to send along with Power of the Channel
20. Board working Status is important for Dashboard. Need to monitor continously the working.
	Raise alarm if board temperature goes high or functionality is faulty in any of the channels
	
Notes:
Save Power on Arduino (Use Sleep Mode on the Controller) - Wake up when a command is received from the
User App frontend

Use Arduino UNO IOT 33 Simulator/Emulator to Write for 4 Channels and send the data to web
User Proteus VSM if Possible. Use the Arduino which is available to perform at least all internet functionality
(Make Circuit around 
MVP Arduino Nano:
4 Channels Current Input
4 Channels Controlling Output
1 Channel for Voltage Input for all Channels
Reading CS with SPI for all Channels

Maximum Arduino Nano IOT33
Total = 33
1 Pin for Voltage Input (Single Phase)
Maximum can accomodate 8 Channels Only
8 Channels Output
We can use the ADC Pins only for the output switching



Order Components only from Germany
1. Similar to the components that are used in the circuit
2. Reliability from Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, STM etc.
3. Do not buy components from China
4. Arduinos as well


Arduino UNO Notes
1. Maximum Current draw per pin 5mA (For driving LEDs, for switching OFF Channels)
